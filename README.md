# Fm helpers
Fm/Helpers are some tools use by other composer modules I made. Comment for my modules are the /.fm.json config file in root folder, where I save configurations. Your can type your own if you like. 

1. /Config
    - ::get('whatever') - return the config section if any

## Composer install
```sh
$ composer require iofficedk/
```
